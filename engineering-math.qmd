# Trigonometry

## Introduction

### The unit circle

The **unit circle** is the circle of radius 1 in the $xy$-plane, centered on the origin. It consists of all points $P$ with coordinates $(x, y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. The coordinate axes divide the unit circle into four **quadrants**, labelled $I$, $II$, $III$, and $IV$, in counter-clockwise sense, starting from the top right.

If we have a point $P$ on the unit circle, with coordinates $(x, y)$, we can associate with $P$ an angle $\theta$, measured from the positive $x$-axis, in counter-clockwise direction.

## Greek letters 

We will often use Greek letters to denote angles: $\theta$ (theta), $\phi$, $\varphi$ (both called phi), $\alpha$ (alpha), $\beta$ (beta), and so on.
:::

There are two ways of measuring angles:

1. By using *degrees*, where one full circle is 360°, half a circle is 180°, a quarter circle 90°, and so. This is which angles are commonly measured, in the "real world".
2. By using *radians*. This way is preferred by mathematicians and scientists, as it is more convenient for scientific applications. In this case, we define the value of the angle in radians to be the length of the arc subtended by the angle. Given that a full unit circle has length $2\pi$, that means that a angle of 360° corresponds to $2 \pi$ radians, an angle of 180° corresponds to $\pi$ radians, and so on. In general, one can convert an angle in degrees to one in radians by multiplying by $\frac{\pi}{180}$.

So, it looks like we established a correspondence between points on the unit circle, and angles, right? Well, not so fast. Given an angle $\theta$ it is true that there is a unique point $P$ with that angle. But conversely, if I have an angle $\theta$ for a given point $P$, I can always add or subtract a multiple of $2\pi$ from $\theta$ and obtain the same point. So to each point there correspond infinitely many angles, $\theta + 2k \pi$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

## Negative angles

Negative angles are measured from the positive $x$-axis in *clockwise* sense.

## Finding the coordinates of a point

We are now in a position where we can determine the coordinates of points, given the angle. Let's take $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ as an example. From the figure you see that $P$ lies on the *first bisector*, the line with equation $y = x$ that divides the first quadrant neatly in two. 

From the equation $y = x$ and the defining equation for the unit circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we find that $2x^2 = 1$ or $x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. We only need the positive solution, so $x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and this is also the value for $y$.

By drawing similarly crafty triangles you can find the coordinates of the points corresponding to angles $\pi/6$, $\pi/3$, and so on (some of these calculations were done in class). 

### Trigonometric functions

We are now in a position to define trigonometric functions like the sine, cosine, and tangent function. To do this, we go back to the unit circle, we take an angle $\theta$ and we let $P(x, y)$ be the corresponding point.

We define the **cosine** of $\theta$ to be the $x$-coordinate of $P$, and the **sine** of $\theta$ to tbe the $y$-coordinate:
$$
    \cos \theta = x, \quad \sin \theta = y
$$
The **tangent** of $\theta$ is the ratio of the sine to the cosine:
$$
    \tan \theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos \theta}.
$$

Besides these three functions, there are three more trigometric functions: the **secant**, the **cosecant**, and **cotangent**, given
$$
  \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}, \quad
  \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}, \quad  \text{and} \quad
  \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan\theta}.
$$
These functions are less often used, but they still play an important role, for example in integration of trigonometric functions. You have to know them and be able to use them in calculations, but you can rely on the fact that each of these three can be expressed as a function of $\cos\theta$ and $\sin \theta$.

## Origin of the name "tangent"

The word "tangent" comes from the Latin for "slightly touching", and appears in other mathematical concepts such as the tangent line. It also makes an appears in spoken language: something that is tangentially related is only slightly related or relevant. 

What is the relation between "touching" and the tangent function? For this we must go back to the unit circle, where we draw the vertical line that touches the unit circle on the right-hand side. We call this line the *tangent line* to the unit circle at the point $(1, 0)$. We also extend the radius through the point $P$ until it hits the tangent line we've just drawn. It then turns out (and you can prove this using similar triangles) that the length of the line segment between the $x$-axis and the radius through $P$ is precisely $\sin \theta / \cos \theta$. Because it arises from a tangent line, we call this ratio the tangent function.

### Graphs of trigonometric functions

### Fundamental identities

Given that the cosine and sine are the $x$- and $y$-coordinate of a point on the unit circle, we have that 
$$
   \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1.
$$   
This is the *fundamental identity* of trigonometry. Many, if not all, other properties follow from this identity.

:::{.callout-note}
## Powers of trigonometric functions

Throughout this course, we will use the notation $\cos^k\theta$ with $k$ a positive number to indicate a trigonometric function raised to a power. For example, $\cos^2 \theta$ is the square of the cosine function, given by $(\cos\theta)^2$.

There is one caveat. Later on, the notation $\cos^{-1}\theta$ will be used to indicate the *inverse cosine* (and similarly for other trigonometric functions), not one divided by the cosine.
:::

By dividing the fundamental identity by $\cos^2 \theta$, we obtain
$$
    \tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta,
$$
and by dividing the fundamental identity by $\sin^2 \theta$, we get
$$
  \cot^2 \theta + 1 = \csc^2 \theta.
$$

### Reflection across the coordinate axes

...

These identities are also referred to as the *even-odd identities*. This name comes from the relation with even and odd functions: a function $f(x)$ is said to be **even** if it satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$, and **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$. From the above, we see that $\cos \theta$ is an even function, while $\sin \theta$ is an odd function.

### Shift formulas

### Addition-subtraction formulas

### Double-angle and half-angle formulas

If we consider the addition formulas and put $\alpha$ and $\beta$ both equal to the same angle $\theta$, we obtain the following **double-angle formulas**:
\begin{align*}
  \sin 2 \theta & = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \\
  \cos 2 \theta & = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \\
  \tan 2 \theta & = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}.
\end{align*}

The formula for $\cos 2\theta$ deserves a closer look. By using the fundamental identity to write $\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta$ or $\sin^2  \theta = 1 - \cos^2 \theta$, we obtain two more expressions for $\cos 2 \theta$:
\begin{align*}
  \cos 2 \theta & = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta \\
                & = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta \\
                & = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1.
\end{align*}
Depending on the circumstances, one or the other of these formulas may be more convenient.

Now, let's consider the second double-angle formula for $\cos 2\theta$, and put $\varphi = 2 \theta$, so that we get 
$$
  \cos \varphi = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \frac{\varphi}{2}.
$$
By re-arranging the terms in this formula, we obtain
$$
  \sin^2 \frac{\varphi}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos\varphi}{2}.
$$
This is the **half-angle formula** for the sine. By a similar procedure, but starting from the third double-angle formula for the cosine, we get
$$
  \cos^2 \frac{\varphi}{2} = \frac{1 + \cos\varphi}{2},
$$
the half-angle formula for the cosine.

The half-angle formulas are useful to eliminate powers of trigonometric functions, something that will be useful when we compute integrals of trigonometric functions. For example, 
\begin{align*}
  \cos^4 \theta & = \cos^2 \theta \cos^2\theta = \left(\frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \right)^2 \\
    & =  \frac{1}{4} \left(1 + 2 \cos 2\theta + \cos^2(2\theta) \right) \\
    & =  \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{3}{2} + 2 \cos 2\theta + \frac{1}{2} \cos 4\theta  \right). \\
\end{align*}
At the end of this course we will see that it is relatively straightforward to compute the integral of the right-hand side.

### Product-to-sum and sum-to-product formulas

## Trigonometry and triangle geometry

The trigonometric functions are important for a number of reasons, one being that they express the ratio of the lengths of the sides in a right-angled triangle. This lets us solve problems of the following kind: if I see the top of a tower under an angle of 30 degrees, and the tower is 300 meters tall, how far away am I from the base of the tower? We will see that the answer is given by $300 \cot 30^\circ \approx 520$ meter.

### Right-angled triangles



### General triangles




The law of sines is useful when you know two angles and one side in a triangle, and you want to know the other sides. Or, alternatively, when you know two sides and one of the angles, and you want to find the other angles.

## Inverse trigonometric functions

### The inverse sine

Your scientific calculator probably has a button labelled "asin" or "arcsin". If you enter $0.5$ in your calculator and press "asin" (short for "arc sine" or "inverse sine"), your calculator will return the value $0.52359877$. This is because $0.52359877$ is approximately $\pi/6$, and asin  gives you the angle whose sine is equal to $0.5$. This tells us that asin is in some sense the "inverse" of the sine function: sine turns $\pi/6$ into $0.5$, and asin turns $0.5$ back into $\pi/6$.

If you continue playing with your calculator, you'll probably notice that that interpretation breaks down in a number of places. First of all, if you compute the inverse sine of a number outside the interval $[-1, 1]$, your calculator will return an error. We can understand why this is by looking at the graph of the sine, as in the figure below. The range of the sine is entirely between -1 and 1, and there are no angles whose sine is, for example, equal to $1.5$.

![There is no angle whose sine is equal to $1.5$.](./images/01-trigonometry/inverse-sine-outside-range.png)

Secondly, if we take the angle $5 \pi/6$ and compute the sine, we again get $0.5$. But the inverse sine of $0.5$ is $\pi/6$, not $5\pi/6$. To see why, let's look at the figure below. There are many angles whose sine is $0.5$ and the inverse sine function has to choose one amongst them. It looks like your calculator chooses the smallest such value in some sense.

![The sine function, and some angles whose sine is equal to $1/2$.](./images/01-trigonometry/inverse-sine-1.png)

These two pieces of intuition allow us to define the inverse sine rigorously. The inverse sine, denoted by $\sin^{-1}(y)$, must return for each $y$ in the interval $[-1, 1]$ an angle $\theta$ such that $\sin \theta = y$. There are many such angles $\theta$ and so we must choose one. Our convention is that we will choose the angle $\theta$ that is in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. As you can from the figure below, this interval is chosen so that for each value $y$ in $[-1, 1]$ there is always *exactly one angle* $\theta$ so that $\sin \theta = y$. 

![For each $y \in [-1, 1]$ there is exactly one $\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ so that $\sin \theta = y$.](./images/01-trigonometry/inverse-sine-limited.png)

With this definition, the inverse sine satisfies the following properties:

- $\sin^{-1}(\sin \theta) = \theta$ for all $\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.
- $\sin(\sin^{-1}(y)) = y$ for all $y \in [-1, 1]$.

### The inverse cosine

Just like the sine function, the cosine function is $2\pi$-periodic and there are many angles $\theta$ such that $\cos \theta = y$. To define $\cos^{-1}(y)$ we therefore have to limit the domain of cosine so that $\theta$ is uniquely defined. In this case, we limit the domain to $[0, \pi]$. With that choice of domain, we again have that for each $y \in [-1, 1]$ there is a unique $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ such that $\cos \theta = y$, and we let $\cos^{-1}(y) = \theta$.

![For each $y \in [-1, 1]$ there is exactly one $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ so that $\cos \theta = y$.](./images/01-trigonometry/inverse-cosine-limited.png)

The inverse cosine satisfies the following properties:

- $\cos^{-1}(\cos \theta) = \theta$ for all $\theta \in [0, \pi]$.
- $\cos(\cos^{-1}(y)) = y$ for all $y \in [-1, 1]$.

The inverse cosine and sine are very closely related. To see this, take $\theta = \cos^{-1} y$ for some $y$. Then $y = \cos \theta$, which we can also write as $y = \sin(\pi/2 - \theta)$. By taking the inverse sine of both sides we end up with $\pi/2 - \theta = \sin^{-1} y$. If we combine this with the previous expression for $\theta$, this tells us that
$$
  \cos^{-1} y = \frac{\pi}{2} - \sin^{-1} y.
$$

### The inverse tangent

Last, to define the inverse tangent function, we use the fact that the tangent function is an increasing function in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. If we limit the domain to that interval, we have that for each $y \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique $\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ such that $\tan \theta = y$, and we define $\tan^{-1}(y) = \theta$.

Note that the domain of $\tan^{-1}$ is the entire set of real numbers! The domains of $\sin^{-1}$ and $\cos^{-1}$ are in both cases the interval $[-1, 1]$.

![The inverse tangent, $\tan^{-1}(y)$, is the unique angle $\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ so that $\tan \theta = y$](./images/01-trigonometry/inverse-tangent.png)

The inverse tangent satisfies the following properties:

- $\tan^{-1}(\tan \theta) = \theta$ for all $\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.
- $\tan(\tan^{-1}(y)) = y$ for all $y \in \mathbb{R}$.
