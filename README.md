Presentations

Slide decks for the weekly lectures can be found in the `presentations`
folder. They are rendered by Quarto to reveal.js format.

One unfortunate aspect is that the standard PDF export from reveal.js is badly
broken. To generate PDFs that match the HTML version of the presentation, I use
the decktape and pdfjam utilities. The Makefile in the presentations folder
will create a good-looking PDF for each slide deck.
